==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

This is the *IT Product and Service Design Playbook*; a key deliverable, or product, produced under the IT Product and Service Design Initiative being executed by Technology Solutions (TS) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) at the Ministry of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services (MTICS).

The purpose of this initiative was to enhance and build upon the previous good work already completed by TS staff in this space[1], in order to operationalize a sustainable process for IT product and service design. It ensures successful adoption across TS through effective change leadership, communications and engagement.

Included in this *Playbook* are:

-   A maturity model to demonstrate a progression of desirable behaviours for IT product and service design and development across TS

-   An IT Product and Service Design process map that visually depicts how new products and services will be designed and developed using a range of traditional and/or multi-modal approaches

-   Simple explanations of each step in the process, including inputs, outputs and checkpoints

-   A governance framework to guide new behaviour and establish key roles and responsibilities

-   Recommendations on how to communicate the enhanced IT Product and Service Design process and encourage sustainable adoption across TS

-   Recommendations on how to automate the IT product and service design process in the future

This *Playbook* will provide the means to change behaviour, leading to sustained operationalization an enhanced IT product and service design process for TS. It will also serve as a communication tool to increase awareness and adoption of the enhanced process.

<span id="_Toc376936482" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc440708950" class="anchor"></span></span>CONTEXT
=====================================================================================================

![alt text](../images/3Qs_BlueRectangle.png "")Driving this initiative is the shared recognition that we need to better understand, anticipate, and manage ministry and broader public sector demand for new IT products and services. We need to align investment decisions with business value to ensure investments are made in the right products and services, and to ensure that we have the right resources to sustain an appropriate portfolio of IT projects. We must change our own product and service delivery behaviour via the adoption of an enhanced-yet-simplified IT product and service design process that crosses all TS service lines. Overall, this more integrated approach aims to create business value for our clients, while reducing complexity and delivering excellent customer service.

In addition to the need for an enhanced IT product and service process, TS requires the introduction of both behavioural governance and structural governance, in an manner that is integrated with the overall process. Governance cannot be a standalone feature – it must be embedded within the process to ensure desired behaviours are reinforced and outcomes are achieved.

![alt text](../images/Desireable_BlueRectangle.png "")We are using an agile approach wherein iterative versions of this *Playbook* will be developed during two-week sprints, allowing us to “fail fast” and turn around quick improvements at a lower total cost. Our agile approach values individuals and interactions over tools and processes, and emphasizes collaboration with our customers.

ASSUMPTIONS 
============

Development of this *Playbook* was guided by the following assumptions:

-   Reviewers have a working knowledge of the difference between, and complementary value of, traditional waterfall, agile and hybrid approaches to IT product and service design and development

-   Users are comfortable with an iterative approach to the constant improvement of its content as our understanding of the requirements evolves through frequent trial and error

The *Playbook* is a living document that is updated regularly and informed by lessons learned along the way.

problem
=======

Primary business drivers for this initiative include:

-   A perception of inconsistent, complex and cumbersome processes for the design and development of new IT products and services at TS

-   Periodic customer dissatisfaction with the way TS carries out IT product and service design and development

-   Inability to balance legitimate customer demands for our IT products and services with our true capacity to deliver

opportunity
===========

In the very near future we will have the tools, frameworks and staff culture required to:

-   Set smart strategic direction and better serve highest priority client needs

-   Anticipate and shape demand for services from our customers

-   Reduce complexity from the IT product and service design process

<!-- -->

-   Allocate resources effectively

-   Achieve higher customer satisfaction

Our vision is that we eventually reach an ideal state wherein:

-   The IT product and service design and development process at TS is clear and consistently applied, and meets the needs of TS stakeholders

-   We are able to accommodate the design and development of a wide range of IT products and services, and the process can adapt to different characteristics and requirements

-   A multi-modal approach to service design and development means we can quickly prioritize new IT products and services that add value and fit with our strategic priorities, blending the best of traditional waterfall (where required) with agile/scrum

-   The governance structure ensures there is clear accountability for decisions and results

====================================================================================================================================================================================================

To address current-state challenges and to move towards the desired future state, the IT Product and Service Design Initiative is iteratively developing the following components:

-   A maturity model to demonstrate a progression of desirable behaviours for IT product and service design and development across TS

-   An IT Product and Service Design process map that visually depicts how new products and services will be designed and developed using a range of traditional and/or multi-modal approaches

-   Simple explanations of each step in the process, including inputs, outputs and checkpoints

-   A governance framework to guide new behaviour and establish key roles and responsibilities

-   Recommendations on how to communicate the enhanced IT Product and Service Design process and encourage sustainable adoption across TS

-   Recommendations on how to automate the IT product and service design process in the future

These components form the main body of this *Playbook*.

maturity model for it product and service design
================================================

A behavioural maturity model has been developed to support the desired progression of behaviours during the adoption of the enhanced IT product and service design and development process.

The model includes four levels of progression:

1.  Legacy

2.  Enhanced

3.  Optimized

4.  Perfected

The model also encompasses eight critical considerations related to new behaviour:

1.  Co-creation with partners and vendors

2.  Demand management

3.  Thinking, behaviour and tools

4.  Governance

5.  Stakeholder priorities

6.  Processes and policies

7.  Vendor influence

8.  Value creation

Figure 1, following, presents a graphical depiction of the maturity model. Subsequent figures present detailed descriptions of desired behaviours and considerations at each of the four levels.

IT Product and Service design process map
=========================================

The intent of this Initiative was to build upon and enhance the good work that was previously done by TS with the assistance from external experts. Earlier versions of IT product and service design process maps were reviewed in detail and used as the foundation for this work.

Through collaboration within TS and with external stakeholders, it has been determined that the enhanced approach should follow four interconnected phases (Initiation, Early Design & Coordination, Design & Development, and Transition) and be guided by two dimensions of governance (Behavioural and Structural).

Presented in Figure 6 is the enhanced IT Product and Service Design Process Map. This map has been developed in an iterative manner and has been guided by numerous workshops and interviews with TS stakeholders.

<span id="_Ref439509553" class="anchor"></span>Figure : IT Product and Service Design Process Map

![alt text](../images/ProcessMap.png "")

The map depicted in Figure 6 is divided into four integrated and connected phases. All four phases are guided by behavioural governance principles and supported by structural governance through Technology Solutions Investment Board (TSIB), Portfolio Management Board (PMB) and Architecture Review Board (ARB). A description of each phase is presented below.

Suggested Roles:

-   Business Partner: A potential consumer of the new product or service.

-   Sponsor: The individual who is responsible for the funding of the effort.

-   Coordinator: An individual who is responsible for ensuring that all stakeholders are kept up to date on progress and are kept engaged in the efforts.

-   Product owner: A TS individual or organization that will manage the product or service once it goes live.

-   Technical Lead: the individual within a Service Delivery Unit most impacted by the change.

-   Design and Development Team members: Individuals who will participate in the design and/or development.

*Phase 1: Initiation*

![alt text](../images/Process_Initiation.png "")

This phase begins with a request for a new or modified technology product or service. It may come from any one of a number of areas. Some examples are:

1.  A Ministry partner desires some new product or service

2.  An individual SDU proposes a new product or service

3.  There is a decision across government to provide the public with a new product or service

This new IT product and service may take the form of a custom built service, provisioned fully by government or it could also include components from vendors, ranging from specific hardware/software items or an entire Software as a Service (SaaS) solution.

*Inputs*:

-   Request for a new product or service

-   Strategic Plans (e.g., 5 pillars)

-   Available resources

-   Documented understanding of the requirement

-   Data entered into Clarity (Project Portfolio Management tool)

*Outputs:*

-   Requests for resources

-   Documentation of the business requirements

-   Understanding of the business objectives

-   Validation of the alignment to BC Government strategic direction

*Process:*

1.  The person requesting the new product or service is engaged to discuss the high-level objectives and rationale

2.  The request is assessed as to its feasibility

    1.  Should we do this?

    2.  Do we have the resources to start?

    3.  Can we build it right?

The process ends when there is agreement on the three questions. If the answer is ‘No” to any of the three, this creates the conditions to exit the Initiation and to not proceed on to the next phase. If the answer is “yes” to all three questions, a team may be formed to proceed into Phase 2.

*Phase 2: Early Design & Coordination*

![alt text](../images/Process_EarlyDesign.png "")

This phase begins when the Business Partner agrees with the documented understanding of the requirements. At this stage the team is formed, the concept is reviewed and initial Proof of Concepts (PoC) are developed. Validation of the solution is performed by the person or client who requested the service or product.

At this point in the process it is important to identify a person who will champion the delivery of the solution and manage communications across the various stakeholder groups. It is important to maintain ongoing involvement and communications with the business partner in order to ensure that the early design meets their required business objectives.

*Inputs: *

-   Approval to start the process

-   Data entered in Clarity tool

-   Documentation of the business requirements

-   Understanding of the business objectives

-   Alignment with Ministry strategic plan

-   Team members

-   Design specifications from previous PoC iterations

-   Confirmation of resource availability

*Outputs: *

-   Early design and prototype of solution

-   Decisions on the subsequent work

-   Go/No Go

*Process:*

1.  A central coordinator is engaged to begin to gather requirements.

2.  Meetings are arranged to begin an evaluation of the request. Participants include: the individual who initiated the request. Participants may include:

<!-- -->

1.  The individual who initiated the request

2.  Technical resources from identified SDUs

3.  Client Services

4.  The eventual TS owner of the product or service (e.g. Service Management Branch)

<!-- -->

1.  The coordinator works with the requestor to:

<!-- -->

1.  Define the overall objective of the IT product/service so that there is a clear picture of the business need being met.

2.  Validate alignment with overall Ministry and Government strategic direction.

3.  Determine whether or not this is an achievable offering.

<!-- -->

1.  The coordinator assesses if other Service Delivery Units (SDUs) should be engaged to review the requirements and the objective.

> **Checkpoint: Sufficient resource commitment to proceed - validate and pivot/exit**
>
> **Re-ask Behavioural Governance questions in Figure 1 and in Section 14**

1.  The team then works to develop a high-level PoC. This should take the form of a deliverable that allows the client to properly assess whether or not the solution will address the requirements. Examples of this are:

<!-- -->

1.  Logical-level drawing/schematic

2.  Screen shots of a new application

3.  Leveraging of existing IT product or service to demonstrate partial functionality

4.  Creation of a new IT product with simple-base functionality

> **Check point: At each iteration confirm whether or not the proof of concept identifies a workable solution. Validate and pivot/exit**
>
> **Re-ask Behavioural Governance questions in Figure 1 and in Section 14**

1.  Individual SDUs determine the logistical implications for:

<!-- -->

1.  Capacity

2.  Architecture

3.  Security

4.  Availability/Continuity

<!-- -->

1.  Service Management Branch determines the implications for:

<!-- -->

1.  Compliance to establish standards

2.  Service Continuity requirements

3.  Agreements on Service Levels

> **Checkpoint: Is this achievable under the current logistical and Service Management constraints **
>
> **- validate and pivot/exit**

**Re-ask Behavioural Governance questions in Figure 1 and in Section 14**

1.  Client Relations ensures that the Business Partner is closely engaged and attends the requirements and PoC meetings to provide direction.

2.  A high-level costing model is refined, based on the understood requirements and the operational support of the service.

3.  The relevant information is entered into Clarity for the purposes of tracking and reporting.

4.  The process of entering the information into the Service Catalogue is initiated.

*Exit Process:*

1.  The sponsor is informed of the decision and their approval to exit is requested.

2.  Reasons for the exit are captured and entered into Clarity.

3.  The type of exit is captured (suggested categories):

    1.  Deferred

    2.  Cancelled

    3.  Delayed for a significant period

4.  A lessons learned session is convened to capture any further material

5.  The Clarity records are updated

6.  The team is released.

This phase ends when the PoC is agreed to and the Business Partner/Sponsor chooses to move forward with formal design and development.

*Phase 3: Design & Development*

![alt text](../images/Process_DesignAndDevelopment.png "")

This stage begins when there is agreement between the Business partner and the Central Coordinator (on behalf of the team) that the proof of concept has captured the requirements. Approval to go forward must be given by the Sponsor, and validated by the Business Partner.

*Inputs:*

-   Early design and prototype of solution

-   Agreement on resources for formal development

-   Acceptance of the concept for further development

*Outputs:*

-   Confirmation of project approach

-   Schedule for delivery of solution

-   Project deliverables that are specific to the modality

-   A completed product or service that is accepted by the Business Partner/Requestor

-   Lessons Learned

-   Exit strategy or closure

-   Information for Service Catalogue and uCMDB

*Process:*

The Design and Development Team is then formed to create the new product/service. The team should consist of:

1.  Business Partner: represents the client business interests and is responsible for ensuring that the solution meets business needs.

2.  Technical Leads: representatives from each Service Delivery Unit that is impacted by the proposed solution

    1.  Designer

    2.  Developer

3.  Communicator/Coordinator: responsible for communicating across the silos and for ensuring that all team members are delivering their component of the solution.

4.  Service Management representative: responsible for ensuring that the solution is supportable in Operations and for ensuring that Operations is providing the relevant service specifications; such as available capacity, Service Level Management (SLM), adherence to policies and standards.

*Considerations for selecting the modality.*

1.  Waterfall

    -   Long lead times are required for the procurement of 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools, hardware, resources

    -   Lower availability of the Business Partner or requestor to actively engage in the ongoing discussions.

    -   The project team has a low tolerance for continual change

    -   Difficult to deliver a working product throughout the lifecycle of the project

    -   High infrastructure component.

    -   High level of governance and reporting required throughout the project.

    -   The requirements are clear and well understood at the outset.

    -   The requirements are not subject to frequent changes.

2.  Agile

    -   Business Partners are willing to commit to active involvement

    -   The team can be structured to facilitate face to face interactions on a frequent basis.

    -   There is acceptance of being able to start work without full requirements.

    -   There is a tolerance for ongoing change through the design and development process

    -   Ability to deliver a working product/service at the end of each development cycle (aka sprint)

    -   Commitment that an early exit will be seen as a money saving choice vs a ‘waste of money’

3.  Hybrid

    -   The Business Partner is actively engaged in both design and testing

    -   Dedicated resources for specific roles during each phase (a design team, a development team, a test team)

    -   The team can be structured to facilitate face to face interactions on a frequent basis.

    -   Phases that can overlap: i.e. - once the first design is complete and handed off to development, the next design phase iteration is started

    -   A partial product or service is delivered during the completion of each development cycle until the final release produces a fully functional product/service.

Once the approach to design and development is determined and work is underway. The process should follow the modality chosen. Detailed activities will be determined by the team during meetings. Regardless of modality, some common items to document and adhere to are:

1.  Budget

2.  Delivery dates

3.  Adherence to TS standards

4.  Team composition

    This process is complete when the client has signed off on the product or service and the TS Product Owner has accepted it for Operations.

*Phase 4: Transition*

![alt text](../images/Process_Transition.png "")

Transition is considered to be out of scope for the first draft of the process map.

Clarification is needed for:

1.  The steps involved to enter the information into the service catalogue

2.  What information is required

behavioural and structural governance
=====================================

A critical consideration of the enhanced IT product and service design and development process is ensuring that governance is embedded within it. Governance will not be effective unless it is integrated with all four stages of the design process.

For the purposes of this *Playbook*, structural governance is defined as the governance bodies, models, and processes that promote executive accountability for effectiveness and results, and enable managerial responsibility for efficiency and performance, as well as TS staff commitment to design and development excellence. Shown in Box B in Figure 7 below, structural governance provides a foundation for the four stages of the design process. Conversely, behavioural governance (Box A below) guides the relationships between key stakeholders involved in the process and encourages desirable behaviours across the organization.

Detailed information on governance principles, assumptions, and key questions may be found in Section 14.

Level 1 process descriptions
============================

The four phases of the IT product and service design and development process can be broken down into successive levels of detail. As shown in Figure 8, at a high level, six Level 1 (L1) processes have been defined. Each process is defined in greater detail in Table 1.

**Governance Purpose**

The purpose of this section is to define the approach to governance for IT product and service design at TS.

![alt text](../images/3Qs_Bluerectangle.png "")

**IT Product and Service Design Governance Assumptions at TS**

-   The terms of reference (ToR) for the TS Investment Board (TSIB) is both robust and complete: it already addresses all of the critical considerations that would otherwise go into a standalone governance model for IT product and service design and development at TS.

-   The governance model that has been developed for the TS Investment Working Group, along with those being contemplated for both the TS Portfolio Management Board and the TS Architecture Review Board will similarly address ‘like’ critical considerations.

-   All of these existing and under-contemplation governance frameworks also adequately address business drivers, business problems and opportunities, and clarity of business purpose: each makes clear that governance is about executive accountability for results (the ends), managerial responsibility for performance (the means) and staff commitment to excellence (the enablers).

-   Each specifies roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities: each speaks to new behaviour, measurements of success, and operating structures, processes and mechanisms.

-   The creation of an elaborate, standalone and redundant governance framework for IT product and service design, development and enhancement at TS is thus not necessary.

-   What is actually required to operationalize effective governance for IT product and service design and development at TS is the introduction and use of a multi-modal play card that defines a set of simple and clear guiding principles which align with both the global ITIL standard *and* the proven principles of agile product and service development that come to us from the Agile Manifesto that has been embraced by leading IT provisioners all across the globe.

**Our Multi-Modal Governance Play Card:**

With the guiding principles defined below in-hand, decision-makers participating within the Investment Board, the TS Investment Working Group, the emerging TS Portfolio Management Board and the under-development TS Architecture Review Board will have the customer-focus lens they require to:

-   Base their decisions related to IT product and service design and development on the needs and expectations of those who TS serves, and with whom it partners and works.

-   Establish evaluation criteria for proposed designs and Concept Cases − and optimally understand, anticipate and influence customer demand for new TS products and services.

-   Effectively review, prioritize and approve requests for new TS products and services − ensuring that decisions on TS product and service investments align with approved strategic direction.

-   Leverage the blended advantages of both traditional waterfall planning *and* agile scrum – and effectively and quickly react to unexpected, if not on occasion catastrophic events.

-   Apply the correct mix of resources, processes and enabling architectures to efficiently allocate scarce government funding to activities that generate greatest gain and value − and alleviate greatest pain and risk, at lowest cost and complexity, and in the shortest amount of time.

**Guiding Principles**

At TS, we are uncovering bold and better ways of designing, developing and enhancing our products and services for the betterment of those we serve, and with whom we partner and work.

We are doing this by embracing innovation and risk, by accepting that periodic failure is normal, and by just getting on with the continuous and iterative improvement of our efforts and investments.

Through this lens, our staff have come to value:

-   People and just doing the work, over processes and tools.

-   Working products and services, over comprehensive documentation.

-   Co-creation and collaboration with customers over, contract negotiation.

-   Responding to necessary change and disruption, over the rote execution of a plan.

When we make decisions and approve investments with respect to the design, development and enhancement of our IT products and services we constantly ask ourselves these defining questions:

1.  **Should we invest in this? Do we have the resources? Are we building it right?**

> *This means never taking on the design or development of an IT product or service at TS unless we are able to do it the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right people and the right tools and processes.*

1.  **Is our highest priority to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of value-creating products and services?**

> *This means getting something workable and immediately effective into the hands of the customer as quickly as possible, and making necessary final adjustments to it after, or even during, initial delivery. *

1.  **Will we, at all times, welcome changing requirements, even late in development? **

> *This means being driven by what the customer actually needs and expects, and not by what the original design specifications had said. *

1.  **Will we deliver iterations of our products and services frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter lifecycle?**

> *This means external customer success trumps internal design perfection. *

1.  **Are we co-creating products and services alongside customers? **

> *This means engaging customers directly in the design process, ensuring that the features and functionality of IT products and services reflect real-world use vs. abstract interpretation of design blueprints. *

1.  **Will we design, develop and enhance products and services around highly motivated staff? Will we give them the tools, the data, the funding, the architectures, the risk tolerance, the insights, and the leadership supports they require? Do we trust them to get the job done?**

> *This means equipping our own people with what they actually require to excel at customer success. *

1.  **Are ‘working products and services’ our primary measure of success?**

> *This means we value customer success more than we celebrate compliance with processes. *

1.  **Do we recognize that *the* most efficient and effective method of conveying information to, and within, a development team is through face-to-face interaction?**

> *This means breaking old habits: spending more time talking to people in-person than we do using devices and electronically processing words in isolation. *

1.  **Will we embrace simplicity: the essential art of maximizing the least amount of work done?**

> *This means being happy with what works. *

1.  **Do we recognize that the very best requirements, architectures and designs emerge form self-organizing teams?**

> *This means giving competent staff clarity of design purpose, minimum specifications, and the freedom to figure it all out on their own through trial and error, free of judgement and micromanagement. *

1.  **Are we reflecting frequently, and at regular intervals, on how our development teams can become more effective and adjust its behaviour accordingly?**

> *This means constant judgement-free reflection on what could have been done differently or better. *

The wording of these questions will be further refined in subsequent product versions of this *Playbook*.

communication, engagement and adoption
======================================

Success for this initiative means:

-   Our executive sponsors remained committed at all times to its execution

-   Staff and stakeholders had a say in shaping the agenda of change

-   Decisions were made with clarity and with confidence

-   We applied lessons learned from our past experiences, and created an optimal blend of traditional waterfall with agile/scrum (i.e., multi-modal)

-   Our customers believed in us, and saw meaningful improvements

The success of the journey of change for this initiative will be critically dependent upon:

-   A simple, clear and practical approach to communication

-   Effective leadership, authentic engagement, and timely knowledge transfer

-   Reassuring MCIOs that this is really about addressing ministry needs and expectations, and working with them to anticipate, influence and meet demands for TS products and services

-   A sensible progression through a maturity model, to move collaboratively and reasonably toward desired behaviours

The change management approach for this initiative is based on the Stages of Cultural Renewal model shown in Figure 9.
